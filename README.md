##Summary

This script has broad use for any election, as it can self-populate with any number of candidates and counties. This data can be vital for campaign management, as it can show you where your funds are best spent when considering advertising, speeches, and mailers. It could even, with only minor adjustments, be made suitable to accomidate national or regional, simply by modifying the "county" analysis to suit a more apropriate division, such as state or city.
